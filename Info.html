    <h1>About Myself</h1>
    <h2>Mark Anthony A. Reyes</h2>
    <p></br>I am an  artist living in Naga City, currently pursuing my passion for digital animation at BISCAST. </br>
        My artistry is characterized by a unique style that blends elements of traditional art with cutting-edge digital techniques.</br>
        As a digital animation student, I am constantly honing my craft through hands-on experience with various software</br>
        programs, including 3D modeling and motion graphics. I am also skilled in graphic design, illustration, and other for</br>
        visual art, making me a versatile and adaptable creator.</br>
        I draw inspiration from a variety of sources, ranging from classic cartoons and anime to contemporary video games and pop culture. </br>
        My art reflects a deep appreciation for storytelling, as I use my skills to bring characters and worlds to life with rich detail and vivid color.</p>
